# Solving Travelling Salesman Problem using the local Search algorithms: Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithm
- Assignment I worked on when taking Fundamentals of AI course- 3rd year, 2nd sem.
- This assignment was focused on to solve tsp for a non-complete graph of the Romanian map found on the page 83 rd of the book Artificial Intelligence, A modern Approach 4th Edition by Stuart Russel & Peter Norvig
## Format to run the Knapsack implementation:- 
          python main.py --algorithm [algorithmType] --file cities.txt
- algorithmType = 'hc', 'sa', 'ga' for hill climbing, simulated annealing and genetic algorithms respectively
